# 📊 Power BI Sales Dashboard – Atliq Technologies

This is my first Power BI project, built by following a tutorial that used sales data of **Atliq Technologies** from the years **2017 to 2020**. The project covers the complete process—from MySQL data extraction to building an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The dashboard provides insights into:
- Total Revenue and Sales Quantity over time
- Market-wise and Product-wise performance
- Year-over-Year trends and key metrics
- Basic interactivity with slicers and filters

It’s a beginner-friendly project that helped me understand the full Power BI workflow including:
- Connecting MySQL to Power BI
- Using Power Query for data transformation
- Creating visualizations and summaries
